If you use the CHR Benchmarks in a scientific publication, please
provide a link to this software as

   F. Nogatz, CHR Benchmarks, https://github.com/fnogatz/CHR-Benchmarks

The benchmark suite was originally created for comparing CCHR with
existing CHR systems. So it is best to cite the original CCHR paper if
you only refer to the original test cases or benchmarking CHR in
general:

   Wuille, P., Schrijvers, T., & Demoen, B. (2007). CCHR: the fastest
   CHR Implementation, in C. In Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on
   Constraint Handling Rules (pp. 123-137).

The benchmarks have been re-run in 2018 and put together in this GitHub
repository. If you refer to more recent CHR benchmarks, please cite this
work as well:

   Nogatz, F., Fr√ºhwirth, T., & Seipel, D. (2018). CHR. js: A CHR
   Implementation in JavaScript. In International Joint Conference on
   Rules and Reasoning (pp. 131-146). Springer.
